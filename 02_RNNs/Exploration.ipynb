    "Recurrent Neural Networks are an specific type of neural network architecture which are able to encode tempral relationships. An RNN cell gets and input and creates an output at every time step. The output is then fed in the next cell again. With the output of the previous cell and the input at the current time steps, the RNN cell can detect temporal relatiionships much better. In the picture below you can see how each input and output of the previous cell is fed into the current cell. Furthermore, there are two ways of sketching such an architecture.\n",

    "For this example, we are using LSTM cells which stands for Long-Short-Term-Memory cells. This is because the cell has a specific internal structure that allows it to decide which information it should forget and which information it should keep. You can see the structure of an LSTM cell in the figure below.\n",
